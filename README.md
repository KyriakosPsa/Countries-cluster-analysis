# Countries-clustering-analysis
The clustering analysis was completed in a `MATALAB` Live editor enviroment.

The objective of this study is to cluster 𝟏𝟔𝟕 countries using socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country and to characterize each resulting cluster (and, consequently, the countries it comprises) based on the relevant values of the above factors.

The relevant data set consists of data from 𝟏𝟔𝟕 countries and for each country there
are 𝟗 factors as shown below:

1. Child_mortality: Death of children under 5 years of age per 1000 live births.
2. Exports: Exports of goods and services per capita. Given as %age of the GDP per
capita.
3. Health: Total health spending per capita. Given as %age of GDP per capita.
4. Imports: Imports of goods and services per capita. Given as %age of the GDP per
capita.
5. Income: Net income per person.
6. Inflation: The measurement of the annual growth rate of the Total GDP.
7. Life_expectancy: The average number of years a new born child would live if the
current mortality patterns are to remain the same.
8. Total_fertility: The number of children that would be born to each woman if the
current age-fertility rates remain the same.
9. GDPP: The GDP per capita (Calculated as the Total GDP divided by the total
population)

The clustering analysis follows these steps: 
1. Feeling the data
2. Normalization
3. Feature selection/transformation
4. Selection of the clustering algorithm
5. Execution of the clustering algorithm
6. Characterization of the clusters
